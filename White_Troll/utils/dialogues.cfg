Note that Melime, Delson and Eruannon are able to summon different types of creatures.
 
Please note that mana can be recovered in the following ways:
• 1 mana point at the start of every turn
• 2 mana points if the unit rested
• in case of early finish, 2 mana points per spared turn
 
Note also that, due to the ephemeral nature of the summoning spell, the summoned creatures will vanish at the end of each scenario."
